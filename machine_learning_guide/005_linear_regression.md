# 005 LINEAR REGRESION #

In this episode we're finally get in greddy your first `machine learning` algorithm - `linear regression`. Now, let's recall machine learning is very hierarchical field. Starting on the top something I call `mathematical decision` making, I don't have accualte call this superfield. Can we broken down into `artificial intelligence`, `statistics`, `operations`, `research`, `control theory` ane some other fileds. `Artificial intelligence` broke down into `machine learning`, that's we are and ML broken down into `supervisor learning`, `unsupervisor learning` and `reinforcement learning`. So we can go  down `supervisor learning` rabbit hole, you will find `supervisor learining` is the bread butter professionaly and even maybe academic in machine learning, of course you can be doubleding `unsupervisor learning`, doesn't came up ofen as `supervisor learning`. Where in `reinforcement learining` it's little bit more like level 99 teritory. You not see this stuff until end game. So here we are `supervisor learning` can be broken down into two more subcategory: `classification` and `regression`, so `classifors` and `regressors`.
