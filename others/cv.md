**Responsibilities**:  

- Proposing technical feasibility solutions for new functional designs.  
- Recommending options for performance improvement of database objects.  
- Building and improvement modules for data analytics warehouse. 
- Designing and implementing a release management solution for data warehouse components.  
- Creating documents whose describe data warehouse modules.  

**Projects**:  
Data Security Layer  
*role: architect/developer*  
*tech stack: sql server 2014/2012/2008, service broker, ssis, db2 warehouse, schedule-in*  
*team size: 5*  

This project provides a tool for prevent**ing unauthorized users from viewing sensitive data. The core component meets the requirements of data access control, masking data and keys integrity. This solution helps one way synchronize data between production and developer environments.  

**Metadata Management**  
*role: developer/tester*
*tech stack: sql server 2014, db2 warehouse*
*team size: 3*

The project focused on an extension of the functionality of a front-end application to manage metadata for business users. I developed additions such as automate generate application templates, two-way synchronize data between the application database and the data warehouse and history of row changes.  

**Responsibilities:**  

- Created and designed database solutions for OLTP which requires high performance.  
- Investigated and resolved SQL Server performance issues.  
- Developed business logic using the SQL Server technologies stack.  
- Designed test for database test using tSQLt and JMeter.  
- Provided 24X7 production systems on-call support.  

**Projects**:  
**Push Messages**
*role: database architect/developer*  
*tech stack: sql server 2008, web-services, test framework tsqlt*  
*team size: 3*  
Push Messages is the module that allows sending the message to clients in batch processing. The main responsibility is reducing waiting times for delivery message. I designed and implemented database objects for the store and push 100k messages per hour and pull message status from external systems.

**Database Monitoring**  
*role: developer*  
*tech stack: sql server 2008, xevents, xml*  
*team size: 1*  
This module provides a way of collecting data from extending events and system views about server and database performance. I developed a tool to get information about deadlocks, waits and collect a value of performance counters. This solution helping with investigate performance problems.

**DCMS Integration** 
*role: developer*    
*tech stack: sql server 2008, web-services, xml, test framework tsqlt, jmeter*  
*team size: 8*  
In this project, I developed many xml web-services based on stored procedures for front-end applications. I concentrated on standardized output from two impedance databases with different data model structure. The next important aspect which I focused on the performance of stored procedures.

**Push data from OLTP to Reporting Server**
*role: desinger/developer* 
*tech stack: sql server 2008/2012/2014/2016*  
*sql server replication, ssis, linked server*  
*team size: 2* 
The main requirements for this project are reduced time and resources consumption of the data extract process. To meet those requirements I extensive used SSIS package.
